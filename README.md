# Implementing MLP Neural Networks on Iris Dataset

This repository provides a Python implementation of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks for classifying the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning and is often used as a beginner's dataset for classification tasks.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each representing an iris flower. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is labeled with three different iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/)
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You could also use Python editors like VS Code or Google Colab to use the '.ipynb' format.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-mlp-neural-network.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd iris-mlp-neural-network
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script:

```
python iris_mlp.py
```

The script will load the Iris dataset, preprocess the data, train an MLP neural network, and evaluate its performance.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the script to experiment with different configurations or try out other datasets. Here are some potential modifications you can make:

- Adjust the architecture of the MLP by changing the number of hidden layers and neurons per layer.
- Tune the hyperparameters of the MLP, such as the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size.
- Try out different activation functions for the hidden layers and output layer.
- Implement additional evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.
